# Visualizing-Tree-Cover-Dynamics-in-the-Philippines
This repository contains our final Data Visualization and Analysis project that examines tree cover dynamics and provincial tree cover loss in the Philippines from 2001 to 2023. The project integrates multiple datasets—including annual tree cover loss, tree cover extent, provincial classifications, and geographic boundary files—to build a comprehensive Tableau dashboard. The dashboard presents choropleth maps, bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) views that allow users to explore spatial patterns, temporal trends, and comparative insights across all Philippine provinces. The repository includes the Tableau workbook, all datasets used for processing and visualization, and the shapefile that enables accurate geographic mapping within the dashboard.
